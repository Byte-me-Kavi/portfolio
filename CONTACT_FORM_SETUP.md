# Contact Form Setup Guide

Your contact form has been updated with a working solution! Here are the available options:

## 🔧 **Current Implementation: Mailto Solution**

**How it works:**

- Form collects user input
- On submit, opens user's default email client
- Pre-fills email with form data to hasindubandara759@gmail.com
- User sends email through their own email client

**Pros:**

- ✅ Works immediately, no setup required
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Users can edit message before sending

**Cons:**

- ❌ Requires user to have email client configured
- ❌ Not seamless (opens email app)

## 🚀 **Recommended: Formspree (Free Service)**

**Setup Steps:**

1. Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io) and sign up (free)
2. Create a new form and get your form endpoint
3. Replace the form in `Contact.tsx` with `FormspreeContactForm.tsx`
4. Update `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual Formspree form ID

**Pros:**

- ✅ Seamless user experience
- ✅ Messages arrive directly in your email
- ✅ Free tier: 50 submissions/month
- ✅ Spam protection included
- ✅ Form analytics

## 📧 **Alternative: Netlify Forms**

If you deploy to Netlify:

1. Add `netlify` attribute to form
2. Add hidden input: `<input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="contact" />`
3. Messages appear in Netlify dashboard

## 🔒 **Enterprise: EmailJS**

For more control:

1. Sign up at [emailjs.com](https://emailjs.com)
2. Connect your email service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Configure email templates
4. Use EmailJS SDK to send emails

## 🏁 **Quick Start with Formspree (Recommended)**

1. **Sign up:** Visit https://formspree.io and create free account
2. **Create form:** Click "New Form" and name it "Portfolio Contact"
3. **Get endpoint:** Copy the form endpoint (looks like `https://formspree.io/f/xzbqwvxy`)
4. **Update code:** In `FormspreeContactForm.tsx`, replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual ID
5. **Replace form:** Use FormspreeContactForm instead of current form in Contact.tsx

Your form will then:

- ✅ Send emails directly to hasindubandara759@gmail.com
- ✅ Work seamlessly without opening email clients
- ✅ Include spam protection
- ✅ Provide submission analytics

## 📝 **Current Status**

Your contact form now works with the mailto solution! Users can:

1. Fill out the form
2. Click "Send Message"
3. Their email client opens with your email pre-filled
4. They can review and send the message

For the best user experience, I recommend setting up Formspree (takes 5 minutes) for seamless form submissions.
